# DAV100_Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Darwin-s-Finches
This is a simple visual analysis of data from the Galapagos islands. I worked on it roughly six months ago. I used the project as a personal experiment to test my capabilities visualizing and drawing complex insights from data in python. The anlysis is really staraight foreward. There aren't to many comments in the code itself as I never meant for it to be used or seen by anyone else. But there is a genearal overview of what is going on in th emark down cells. Idealy, I would like to continue to develop my skills to the point I can confidenatly prepare data for deployment for machine learning models. I am quite far away from that goal. At best this demonstrates my modest skill in data visualization with python and ability to draw insights from data.
