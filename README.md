# DAV100_Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Darwin-s-Finches
This is a simple visual analysis of data from the Galapagos Islands. I worked on it roughly six months ago. I used the project as a personal experiment to test my capabilities visualizing and drawing complex insights from data in python. The analysis is straight forward. There aren't too many comments in the code itself as I never meant for it to be used or seen by anyone else. But there is a general overview of what is going on in the markdown cells. Ideally, I would like to continue to develop my skills to the point I can confidently prepare data for deployment for machine learning models. I am quite far away from that goal. At best, this demonstrates my modest skill in data visualization with python and the ability to draw insights from data. Feel free to ignore the Python. Focus on the plain English and graphs.
